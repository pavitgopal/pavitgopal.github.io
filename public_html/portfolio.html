          <p>
            As a software engineering intern at <a href="https://www.harman.com/">Harman International</a>, I developed a migration application using C#, .NET framework, and WinForms. This tool allowed users to upload audio design files exported from a no longer used software and convert it into the format of the newer software.
          </p>
          <p>
            This migration process involved extracting information from the old software, translating the xml files, decrypting meta data files, and generating JSON structures from newly parsed information.

            This upcoming summer, I look forward to interning at Bank of America as a Quant Analyst!
          </p>
          <p>
            I had the pleasure of talking to numerous recruiters at <a href="https://www.bankofamerica.com/">BOFA</a> and interviewing with the company at the Grace Hopper Conference this past fall. 
            <p>Through the connections I was able to make at this conference, I secured an exciting opportunity to spend this summer at their headquarters in Charlotte, North Carolina!

    <h2 class="sub-header">Reveille Rides</h2>
    <p>Served as a project manager for Reveille Rides, a bus application designed for the Texas A&M University community. 
    </p>
    <p>When the TAMU bus application market became open this past fall, following the privatization of the Universityâ€™s transportation system API, Reveille Rides was birthed during a weekend Hackathon.
    </p>
    <p>Since then, the project has grown in both members and features that include real-time bus tracking, departure schedules,route alerts, user-friendly interfaces, and the ability to save favorites routes. 
    </p>
    <p>You can now download this application on the <a href="https://reveillerides.app/">Apple Store</a>!!

    <h2 class="sub-header">Connect Four</h2>
    <p>In my CSCE 314 (Programming Languages class) project, I had the exciting opportunity to develop an interactive game using JavaFX Scene Builder.</p>

    <p>You can view this project on my <a href="https://github.com/pavitgopal/ConnectFour">GitHub</a> and watch the demo video <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRcRRX6G_bU">here</a>!
    
    <p>Unlike typical two-player games, this project offered a unique twist: players could challenge an AI opponent with customizable difficulty levels, choosing between "Easy" and "Hard" modes.</p>
    
    <p>In "Easy" mode, the game's moves were primarily randomized, creating an unpredictable experience. On the other hand, "Hard" mode featured a more sophisticated AI that made intelligent decisions. The AI followed a strategic approach, prioritizing moves in the following order:</p>
    
    <p>- Attempting to make a winning move if available. </p>
    <p>- Blocking the opponent from achieving a winning move. </p>
    <p>- Placing a pawn strategically to disrupt areas with consecutive pawns. </p>

    <h2 class="highlighted-title">About Me</h2>
    <p>I am a current computer science and business student at Texas A&M who has always been interested in innovation. I think that creating something novel is a beautiful process, but creating something that's life-changing for society is tied to accessibility.</p>
    <p>I don't think that computer classes innately draw attention to the need for accessibility as much as they should. Technology is always about change and growth. This process really requires understanding your target audience and the small but significant accommodations they might require.</p>
    <p>Additionally, I've always been fascinated by the exploration of accessibility across various political, psychological, and technological lenses. Understanding how society perceives certain aspects of accessibility is pivotal in bridging current gaps that may exist in technology.</p>
    <p>Ultimately, my goal is to work in a field that allows me to explore the intersection of technology and accessibility. I want to be able to create products that are not only innovative but also accessible to all.</p>
